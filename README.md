# TextEditorApp

## Description
This project is a sophisticated Text Editor that runs directly in the browser. Designed as a Progressive Web Application (PWA), it offers a seamless user experience both online and offline. Leveraging the power of IndexedDB for data persistence, it ensures that your notes or code snippets are safely stored and can be retrieved anytime, under any network conditions. This application is built with modern web technologies including a service worker for offline functionality and asset caching, ensuring a reliable and fast user experience.

## Features
- PWA: Installable on any device, functioning offline.
- Data Persistence: Utilizes IndexedDB with idb for reliable data storage and retrieval.
- Modern JavaScript: Bundled with Webpack and transpiled with Babel for next-gen JavaScript support.
- Service Worker: Implemented using Workbox for efficient asset caching and offline functionality.
- User Interface: Clean and intuitive design, closely matching the provided mock-up functionality.
- Deployment: Fully deployed on Render with a live URL.

## Usage
Open the application in your browser. You can add new notes or code snippets. Even without an internet connection, the application will save your data to IndexedDB. When the application is back online, it can still access the saved data.

To install the application on your desktop, look for the 'Install' button in the browser address bar or within the application interface.
